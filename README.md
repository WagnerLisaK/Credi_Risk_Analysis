# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview
Because credit risk is inherently unbalanced, there are many ways to handle this issue when predicting credit risk.First, I oversampled the data, then undersampled the data, then used a combination of over- and under-sampling of the data, to create more complete data sets.  

Once the datasets were established, I used two machine learning models that reduce bias - BalaceRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifer.  The results of these models were evaluated and a recommendation given.

## Results
1. Naive Random Oversampling
     * 0.647 Balanced Accuracy Score
     * 
2. SMOTE Oversampling

3. ClusterCentroids Undersampling

4. Combination Sampling
